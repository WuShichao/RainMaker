## How to run Mark Voit's original IDL code
The original IDL code, written by Mark Voit, is included here in the file
``tc_tff_auto.pro``. 

To run this*: 
* BASH > ``idl`` (e.g., type ``idl`` on your command prompt) 
* IDL >``.comp tc_tff_auto``
* IDL > tc_tff_auto,"CENTAURUS" (e.g., run a fit for Centaurus data included in the ``ACCEPT_profiles/`` subdirectory)
* IDL > ``.cont`` (continue after you run into a ``STOP`` after each plot)

*of course, you must have a licenced version of IDL installed.
